# password-list-creator

this tool is for educational purposes only.

it's a simple tool but, returns a very good password list for brute forcing using the info you'll input. easy to use... but only use for legal stuff :).
(anyway I made this only for my personal use but... whatever.)

//Installation

##sudo git clone https://github.com/Maneth-M/password-list-creator.git

##cd password-list-creator

##python3 passwd-creator.py

have fun!!!
